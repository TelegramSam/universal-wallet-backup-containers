## Abstract

This spec details a Universal Container for Wallet Backups, in a way that promotes common data formats and also allows for wallet specific data. This enables both backup and restore flows for a single wallet, and also migration from one wallet to another by backing up from one and restoring to the other.

This work includes the specification of data combination, compression, and encryption, as well as metadata structures and overall backup structure.

This work does not include syncronization between multiple wallets owned by the same entity.
